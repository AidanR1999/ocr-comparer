Nixon a trailblazer in use
of television in politics


  RICHARD Nixon's political
  career was virtually de-
  fined by his memorable
TV appearances. In fact, he was
one of the first modern politicians
to really use television creatively.
  That was in 1952, when vice
presidential candidate Nixon's
place on the Republican ticket
was in jeopardy over his alleged
improper use of an $18,000
"slush fund" to pay personal ex-
penses. Nixon decided to boldly
face the nation on television.
Speaking from a comfy living-
room setting, he "confessed" to
accepting a campaign gift -~ the
family's beloved little dog, Check-
ers.
  Now treasured as a comical TV
clip, the "Checkers speech" was
inspired television. It saved Nix-
on's career by humanizing him
and making the charges seem
trivial. The same strategy has
been used by many others since,
including Democratic candidate
Bill Clinton, who appeared during
the 1992 presidential campaign
on CBS-TV's "60 Minutes" with
his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton,
to answer charges of womanizing.

  An overconfident Nixon creat-
ed another set of vivid TV memo-
ries in his 1960 campaign for
president by foolishly agreeing to
a series of debates with Demo-
cratic candidate John F. Kenne-
dy. Nixon was then far better
known than Kennedy, but the
cameras betrayed him. He looked
nervous and perspiring next to


the cool, calm and handsome Ken-
nedy.
  Those debates, which many be-
lieved cost Nixon the otherwise
closely contested election, forever
altered the way candidates are
packaged for television. Makeup
artists and video image consul-
tants began to flow into politics.
  My only person-to-person meet-
ing with Nixon came after his de-
feat by Kennedy. While running
for governor of California, he
granted me a breezy "walking in-
terview" during a whistle-stop
appearance in Hollister. A few
weeks later, he was defeated by
Democrat Edmund G. "Pat"
Brown and gave us another un-
forgettable TV moment: his "fi-
nal" press conference, in which
he attacked the print media for
unfairness, but praised TV cover-
age. His farewell line: "You won't
have Nixon to kick around any-
more."
  
  But Nixon rebounded to win
the 1968 Republican presidential
nomination. On his way to victo-
ry, he used television relentlessly,
often without much taste. To
show he had a sense of humor, he
even did a "blackout" on NBC-
TV's "Laugh-In," saying, "Sock it
to me!"

  Which the media did once the
Watergate revelations began to
prove damaging in the early
1970s. Nixon tried to fall back on
his Checkers strategy, making a
series of futile direct TV appeals
to the public via "fireside" chats
