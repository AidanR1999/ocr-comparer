Michigan city contracts valet service
to park cars for weekend dining crowd

  ROYAL OAK, Mich. -~ Richard Spehar used to
watch frustrated customers circle his Royal Oak
restaurant searching for parking.
  "These people made reservations," said Spehar,
co-owner of Daniel's. "They didn't want to hassle
with parking."
  The hassle is over, at least on Fridays and Satur-
days, for patrons of Royal Oak's cluster of trendy
restaurants and night spots. The city has contracted
with a local valet parking company, which charges
patrons $3.
  "We're the only city in Michigan who has con-
tracted with a valet service," Royal Oak Treasurer
Michael Kondek said. "It seems like a success."
  About 25 Guardian Parking Services attendants
park about 500 cars on city lots from 6 p.m. to 2:30
a.m. Fridays and Saturdays. Guardian pays the city
$360 a month for a license fee, Kondek said.
  "It's been real helpful," said Spehar.


  The service picks up cars from six locations. Pa-
trons can have their cars parked from one location
and can send for them from another.
  "Anything they can do helps," said Mike Mihalich,
owner of the recently revamped Main Art Theatre.
But, he adds, "there is still a parking problem."
  Mihalich said he hopes the service will be expand-
ed to other days, but the city is still evaluating the
current arrangement.
  Part of the traffic congestion is caused by cus-
tomers' reluctance to use the city's five-story park-
ing structure, Kondek said. Parking is free in the
structure after 6 p.m.
