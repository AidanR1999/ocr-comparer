Philadelphia garbage going to the pigs


REUTER NEWS SERVICE

  DEPTFORD, N.J. -~ Candy
may be dandy, but swine is also
fine.
  That is how Philadelphia feels
about hogs. What is garbage for
Philadelphia makes for a move-
able feast for New Jersey pigs.
  Philadelphia saved $3 million
last year and also reduced its
garbage mound by allowing its
leftover food scraps to be picked
for use as meals for New Jersey
pigs, which have come to be
known as porky recycling ma-
chines.
  Twice a week, New Jersey pig
farmers make pre-dawn trips
into Philadelphia to pick up or-
ganic garbage left out by 2,000
Philadelphia households.
  The city pays out $1.9 million
to the New Jersey pig farmers
for picking up the waste each
year, which works out to about
$79 a ton, said Fernandez. But
the city would have had to pay
$125 a ton for curbside recycling
of the same food waste.
  Last year, the pig farmers
picked up 24,000 tons of the city's
food waste.
  "It makes me feel real good
when I put out my organic gar-
bage, knowing I am also recy-
cling food waste and saving the
city money at that same time,"
said Fernandez.
  Actually, the pig-feeding pro-
gram has been in existence since
the turn of the century, but is has
been accelerated in the past few
years, mainly due to the high cost
of trash recycling programs.
  "The garbage is a good source
of feed, and it's a lot cheaper
than corn," said Neil McIntyre
Jr., whose 2,500-head, 25 acre
farm in Deptford is one of the
state's last pig farms.
  McIntyre said his father began
making the rounds searching for
pig food in Philadelphia more
than 50 years ago.
  "We leave here at 3:30 in the


The waste is cooked before it
is dumped in the troughs for the
pigs. The pig farmers pick up all
food waste, including bones,
rinds, egg shells, fruit and vege-
table scraps, or any scraps from


food preparation.
  "You know pigs, they will eat
just about anything," said Fer-
nandez. However, she pointed out
no coffee grounds, glass, paper or
plastic are accepted.
