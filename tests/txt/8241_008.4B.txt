  WASHINGTON -~ U.S. mili-
tary officials were headed to Tur-
key to attend a memorial service
for the 26 persons killed when two
U.S. Army helicopters were shot
down by U.S. Air Force jets over
Iraq, the Defense Department an-
nounced Saturday.
  Deputy Defense Secretary John
M. Deutch and Adm. William A.
Owens, vice chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, were to represent
the Defense Department at the
service today at Incirlik Air Base.
  As of late Saturday, only two
victims of the air disaster had
been identified officially. They
were a State Department em-
ployee once cited for heroism and
an Air Force lieutenant.
  The families of other victims
were coming forward to identify
their relatives.
  The Defense Department said
Friday that 2nd Lt. Laura Ashley
Piper, 25, was aboard one of the
two Army Blackhawk helicopters
shot down by two F-15 jets north


of Irbil, Iraq.
  The State Department issued a
statement Friday confirming the
identity of Barbara L. Schell, a
member of its foreign service
since 1966 who had been cited for
heroism. She was foreign policy
adviser to the general in com-
mand of the military and relief
mission to protect the Kurds in
Iraq.
  A Kurdish official in Turkey
identified two other victims as
Army Col. Jerry Thompson, the
outgoing commander of the Mili-
tary Coordination Center in
Zakho, northern Iraq, and Army
Col. Richard A. Mulhern, his re-
placement.
  Shazad Saib, a spokesman for
the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan,
said the colonels were flying to a 
meeting with the representatives
of the U.N. office that coordinates
humanitarian efforts.
  Another victim was identified
as Warrant Officer John W. Gar-
rett Jr., 33, a veteran of the Per-
sian Gulf war.
  Army Warrant Officer Michael


Allen Hall, 28, also died aboard
one of the helicopters, his father,
Allen Hall, told the Santa Rosa
(Calif.) Press-Democrat.
  Also, the mother of Spc. Jeffrey


Colbert, 22, told The Associated
Press her son was aboard one of
the downed helicopters. Arnita
Colbert-Sowers of Tawneytown,
Md., said military officers called
her Thursday to say her son's heli-
copter had been shot down.

  Meanwhile in northern Iraq, al-
lied planes resumed their patrols
Saturday over the "no-fly" zone.
The flights, which were canceled
for 24 hours, were restarted on a
reduced schedule and under
amended guidelines while an Air
Force-led investigation into the
cause of the crash continued.
