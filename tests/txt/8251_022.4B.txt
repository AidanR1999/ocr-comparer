Doctors, FDA studying proper use of pedicle


By CAROL GENTRY

  Spine surgeons say there are two key but separate
issues about pedicle-screw surgery that keep getting
stuck together:
  ~ Is pedicle-screw surgery safe, or at least as safe
as other alternatives for severe spinal injury and
deformity?
  ~ Is the surgery getting a bad reputation because it
is being done by improperly trained doctors on the
wrong patients?
  Spine experts say the answer to both questions is
yes. They are concerned about doctors performing the
surgery without completing a spine fellowship or an
adequate training program. And they're concerned
about it being done on patients for simple disc prob-
lems or low-back pain that should be treated conserva-
tively.
  "It does need to be put in by somebody who's
experienced," said Dr. Douglas Weiland of the Florida
Spine Institute in Clearwater. "It has potential for
danger."
  In a prepared statement, the FDA said the safety of
the screw surgery hasn't been proven yet. FDA
officials feel the surgery is probably okay for certain
medical problems but note there is a scarcity of valid
scientific evidence, said Mark Melkerson of the agen-
cy's orthopedic devices branch.
  Earlier studies were flawed for a variety of rea-


sons, he said, and the manufacturers didn't correct the
flaws when they were pointed out.
  Melkerson concedes that the FDA created some of
the problems by changing its rules in midstream.
"Nobody comes out of this looking clean," he said.
  The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons,
the American Academy of Neurological Surgeons and
the North American Spine Society all have issued
position papers saying spine fixation with pedicle
screws appears superior to alternatives for certain
patients.
  Using anything other than pedicle-screw surgery
on some patients would deprive them of the best care


and therefore would be "simply wrong," said the spine
society.
  It sounds scary to hear that doctors are using a
device in a way that hasn't received FDA approval, but
actually it happens all the time -~ with both devices
and drugs. This is called "off-label" use, and it is
perfectly legal.
  It is not unusual for medical knowledge to move
ahead of FDA regulatory processes. Artificial hip joints
were implanted for years before the agency approved
them.
  Also, it costs so much to run clinical studies that
manufacturers sometimes stop testing after getting
approval for one or two uses. They can advertise their
product only for the FDA-approved uses, but doctors
can apply their knowledge and hunches to use it in
whatever way they think best.
  What got the FDA in a tizzy over pedicle screws
last year was that some manufacturers were putting
on quickie courses to teach surgeons how to do the
operations. To begin with, it is illegal to promote a
product for off-label use. Then there is the question of
whether the surgery is too complicated to learn
adequately in just a few days.
  So last August, the FDA sponsored a symposium to
collect information on pedicle screws. At the meeting
surgeons said the devices are useful in treating spinal
fractures, tumors, severe scoliosis (curvature of the
spine) and spondylolisthesis (when the spine slips out
 

To report problems
Any time a surgeon recommends an opera-
tion, except in an emergency, you should seek
a second opinion from a surgeon who is not
part of the same medical-practice group. As
for back stabilization with pedicle screws, the
FDA says the failure rate for the screws ap-
pears to be very small, and most patients are
not likely to have serious problems with them.
Patients who want to report problems with
screws or any other medical device may call
the FDA at (800) 332-1088, option 3.
