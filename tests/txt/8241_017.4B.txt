contra rebellion in Nicaragua

  MANAGUA, Nicaragua -~ A
contra guerrilla leader and the last
of his fighting force have dis-
armed in northern Nicaragua,
closing perhaps the final chapter
in the country's long civil war.
  Jose "The Jackal" Angel Tala-
vera and 380 fellow fighters laid
down arms Friday in their remote
mountain stronghold of Quilali,
180 miles north of Managua.
  The disarmament is the last
stage of an agreement to end the
resurgent contra rebellion that
shattered postwar calm with
clashes and hostage-taking. Nica-
ragua's civil war ended in 1990,


but a new rebellion flared last
summer.

  Sergio Caramagna, a peace
monitor for the Organization of
American States, on Saturday
praised the demobilization as a
great achievement in "maintain-
ing the peace in Nicaragua." He
said it would help restore interna-
tional confidence in Nicaragua's
economy.

  The country remains racked by
high unemployment following a
U.S. freeze on at least $100 mil-
lion in aid. President Violeta
Chamorro is expected to use the
demobilization in a pitch for re-
newed foreign investment.
