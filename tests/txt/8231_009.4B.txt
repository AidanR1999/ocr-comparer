Unique museum devoted solely to shells


ASSOCIATED PRESS

  SANIBEL, Fla. -~ To R. Tuck-
er Abbott, life is one big shell
game. After all, he's as a mala-
cologist.
  "I've always strived to make it
fun and easy to understand," Ab-
bott says of his science, the study
of mollusks like snails, conchs
and clams and their shells.

  Now, he is striving to bring it
all together in the 25,000-square-
foot Bailey-Matthews Shell Mu-
seum nearing completion on San-
ibel Island.

  The $1 million museum is
scheduled to open at the end of
the year on this Gulf Coast island
just off Fort Myers. It will be the
only one dedicated strictly to
shells, Abbott said.
  "Other museums have mollusk


exhibits but they also have but-
terflies and elephants and  a little
of everything," he said. "We will
be totally devoted to mollusks."
  Among the museum's thou-
sands of shells will be some fos-
sils 30 million years old.
  Among its most prized posses-
sions are two left-sided sinistrals,
small, vertically curved shells
with openings on their left sides.
  What makes the pair so special
is that they are the only undam-
aged ones ever found.
  The museum's location is a
natural. Sanibel has an interna-
tional reputation as a great place
for shell collecting. Hundreds of
collectors armed with flashlights
often swarm its beach before
dawn.
  Abbott is also a natural to di-
rect the museum. He has worked
at the Smithsonian Institution in


Washington, the Philadelphia
Academy of Natural Sciences
and as assistant director of the
Delaware Museum of Natural
History.
  "He's done more to further the
study of malacology and conchol-
ogy than anyone else," said Har-
ry Chippeaux, president of the
Southwest Florida Conchologist
Society in Fort Myers.
  With his colorful seashell
shirts and silly seashell jokes,
Abbott also has done whatever he
could to make the study of mol-
lusks and their shells fun.

  The museum's exhibits will in-
clude one on carrier shells, which
attach themselves to other shells
for camouflage. It is called
"First Shell Collectors."

  "I guess I got `carried away,'"
says Abbott.
