Clintons' openness
on Whitewater
credited to Cutler


White House counsel
advocates disclosure

  WASHINGTON -~ Six weeks
after he joined the staff to stanch
the Whitewater hemorrhage,
Lloyd Cutler's influence on White
House strategy became unmistak-
able Friday.
  That was when Hillary Rod-
ham Clinton broke her silence and
fielded every question reporters
could come up with about her


family's financ-
es. It was a clear
manifestation of
the promise Cut-
ler made when
he became White
House counsel to
make public all
the facts on hand
about the invest-
ments made by
President Clin-
ton and his wife.


  After the session, Cutler dis-
claimed credit for Hillary Clin-
ton's decision to go public, saying
in a phone conversation that ev-
eryone at the White House had
agreed it was the proper course.

Cutler convinced Clintons

  But others on the staff said it
never would have happened be-
fore Cutler arrived and impressed
on the Clintons the importance of
openness.
  In an interview last week in his
office, Cutler told how he thinks
the Whitewater story will end.
  "It will just peter out," he said.
"It will leave everybody some-
what dissatisfied, because we're
not going to get a jury verdict in
the end, guilty or not guilty.
There will be questions that can't
be answered. But people will lose
interest. I don't see anything that
even remotely resembles Iran-
Contra, Watergate, any kind of
misconduct while in office."
  At first, his strategy of open-
ness led to embarrassing slips, es-


complicated and come from so
many different record sources
that it's very difficult to get all of
it straight. And every day you
have to compromise between the
press's demand -~ they're going
to write the story anyway, and
television has to meet its dead-
lines -~ and the lawyer's desire
to make sure you have it abso-
lutely straight and have exhaus-
ted all the factual material you
can get your hands on."
  Although no one will say so on
the record, the prevailing view on
the staff is that Cutler's predeces-
sor, Bernard Nussbaum, inadver-
tently damaged the Clintons by
appealing to their predilection for
secrecy about their financial af-
fairs. Cutler, it is said, convinced
the Clintons that they needed to
make everything public, the soon-
er the better.
  The most Cutler would say
about this was that questions
about the Clintons' personal fi-
nances had perhaps been taken
too seriously in the past.
  Not surprisingly, Cutler, 76, a
pillar of the Washington legal es-
tablishment who was White
House counsel in President Cart-
er's administration, has nothing
but nice things to say about the
Clintons.

`I like the two of them'

  "I must say I like the two of
them," he said. "And I like the
Clintons we're getting to know -~
the real Clintons, blemishes and
all." The picture of the first lady
as "a shrewd and lucky commodi-
ties speculator," he said, "is a lot
better than the St. Hillary im-
age."

  And just as predictably, others
on the White House staff speak
highly of Cutler. George Stephan-
opoulos, the senior adviser to the
president, said that "by providing
a respected outside voice, he
helped calm the waters."

staff secretary assigned to field
press inquiries on Whitewater,
