Clinton backs independent Social


New York Times

  WASHINGTON -~ In a reversal of ad-
ministration policy, President Clinton
says he now supports the creation of an
independent federal agency to run Social
Security, the nation's biggest social pro-
gram.
  The change, administration officials
say, is the result of an informal deal be-
tween Clinton and Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, the New York Democrat who
is chairman of the Finance Committee. In
exchange for the president's support for
the new agency, the officials said, Moyni-
han will redouble his efforts to get a


health bill out of the Finance Committee
by the end of May.
  Moynihan and lobbyists for the elderly
have long sought the change for Social
Security, saying it would bolster public
confidence in the program. Some 42 mil-
lion people now receive monthly Social
Security benefits.
  Clinton's support virtually guarantees
that the Social Security administration
will be given independent status. The
agency, created in 1935, is now part of the
Department of Health and Human Ser-
vices. With outlays of $318 billion this
year, Social Security accounts for 50 per-
cent of the department's budget and 21
percent of the entire federal budget.


  In March, by a voice vote, the Senate
approved a bill to establish Social Securi-
ty as an independent agency. The House
has passed similar bills three times in the
last decade, most recently by a vote of
350-8, but those bills died in the Senate.
  Donna E. Shalala, the secretary of
health and human services, opposed the
creation of an independent agency. Like
her predecessors in the Reagan and Bush
administrations, she argued that Social
Security must be closely coordinated with
Medicare, Medicaid and other programs
run by the department. People apply for
Medicare at Social Security offices.
  Moynihan said, "Social Security was
once a model agency run by the great civil


servants of the New Deal era." But in the
last 15 years, he said, "the agency has
lost some of its distinctive energy" as top
officials in the department focused in-
creasingly on health policy.
  In recent years, the senator said, the
Social Security Administration has been
"brain dead and lost in the exurbs of the
Department of Health and Human Ser-
vices." As a result, he said, service to ben-
eficiaries has deteriorated and a majority
of workers fear that Social Security will
not have enough money to pay the retire-
ment benefits they have earned.
  Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois
Democrat who is chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee, said that
