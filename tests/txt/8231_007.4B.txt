  ALMA, Colo. -~ High in the Rock-
ies, the fight between a small city
and a tiny town ended in a draw:
Both can claim bragging rights
about their loftiest claims.
  The opponents in the battle for the
title of highest city in North Ameri-
ca were Alma, population 160, and
Leadville, population 3,100.
  Leadville, about 15 miles west of
Alma, had long claimed it was the
highest incorporated municipality on
the continent. Then last week, it de-
clared its official altitude was 10,152
above sea level.
  Alma contested  the claim, saying
it sat at 10,355 feet above sea level.
  Then Leadville found a spot within
city limits at 10,430 feet.
   Not to be outdone, Alma officials
took a closer look at their own sur-
vey maps.
  "It got our dander up, and when
the dander's up in Alma, it's the
highest dander in North America,"
said town board member Bob En-
sign.
  The maps recorded one measure-
ment at 10,578 feet, putting an end
to the height war. Leadville would
have to annex a mountain peak to
outdo Alma.
  Alma residents proved to be sport-
ing winners, extending a peace offer-
ing to Leadville neighbors by claim-
ing only to be the highest "town" in
North America.
