Black family: Apartheid
`leaves you broken'

BY MICHAEL PARKS

  `APARTHEID crushes you, it squeezes the life
  out of you, it leaves you broken before the
  end of your years,' Shirley Mofokeng said
with a sigh. "Simply to live under apartheid has been a
day-by-day, even hour-by-hour, struggle for us all."
  Recently, a hush fell over the Mofokengs' small liv-


ing room in Sowe-
to, the huge black
city outside Johan-
nesburg, for Shir-
ley Mofokeng was
talking about the
death of her hus-
band, Abner, six
years ago at the
age of 51 from 
what she simply
called "a weakened
heart."
  The Mofokengs'
struggle to survive
as a family is the
story of South Af-


rica's 35.8 million blacks, mixed-race coloreds and
Asians whose rights and very humanity apartheid
denied.
  That struggle, multiplied across a rich and varied
land and intensified from one generation to the next,
finally brought an end to what the oppressed had
damned as "The System" -~ the almost absolute con-
trol that the 5.2 million whites, particularly the polit-
ically dominant Afrikaners, had built over the centu-
ries.
