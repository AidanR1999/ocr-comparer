Excerpts from Ralph Ellison's writings
"I am an invisible man. No, I am not a spook like those who
haunted Edgar Allan Poe; nor am I one of your Hollywood-movie
ectoplasms. I am a man of substance, of flesh and bone, fiber
and liquids -~ and I might even be said to possess a mind. I am
invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me.
Like the bodiless heads you see sometimes in circus sideshows,
it is as though I have been surrounded by mirrors of hard, dis-
torting glass. When they approach me they see only my sur-
roundings, themselves, or figments of their imagination -~ in-
deed, everything and anything except me."
                              -~ The opening of Invisible Man.
"In the beginning was not the shadow, but the act, and the prov-
ince of Hollywood is not action, but illusion. Actually, the anti-Ne-
gro images of the films were (and are) acceptable because of the
existence throughout the United States of an audience obsessed
with an inner psychological new to view Negroes as less than
men. Thus, psychologically and ethically, these negative images
constitute justifications for all those acts, legal, emotional, eco-
nomic and political, which we label Jim Crow. The anti-Negro im-
age is thus a ritual object of which Hollywood is not the creator,
but the manipulator. Its role has been that of justifying the widely
held myth of Negro unhumanness and inferiority by offering en-
tertaining rituals through which that myth could be reaffirmed."
              -~ From the essay The Shadow and the Act, Dec. 6, 1949.
