Reaching out to kids 
before they are lost
There were times when Donna would look
at her 8-year-old son, Martin, and just cry,
her memory jarred, her emotions jangled
by his tortured existence.
  His behavior ranged from wildly inconsistent to
totally inappropriate, especially as it involved his
2-year-old twin sisters.  Martin's overtures toward 
them were so blatantly sexual that Donna feared
she was raising a child molester.
  He talked malevolently of burning down the house,
and Donna caught him in a bedroom closet with
matches, part of a stash hidden under his mattress.
  His behavior at school was so disruptive that his
teachers insisted he get counseling.  His tantrums
became so violent that neighborhood parents would
not allow their children to play with him.
  Even an 8-year-old can sense unacceptance, can
come to believe he doesn't fit in anywhere, and Don-
na was alarmed by the depth of those feelings in
Martin when he talked of killing himself as the solu-
tion to the family's problems.  When she found him
in the front yard with a rope and a stool under a tree,
her desire to get him help turned desperate.
  And she blamed herself.  Donna was in an alcoholic
haze for the first four years of Martin's life.  She loved
her son, but she was incapable of truly caring for
him, and his father was never in the picture.  Sobri-
ety has turned Donna into an attentive, competent
mother, and she gets help from husband Miguel,
the father of her twins.  But she's convinced that the
demons tormenting Martin took hold of him while
she was drinking and his welfare was a marginal
concern to her and the other troubled souls who
moved through their lives.
  "I was a drunk,"  Donna says simply.  "I didn't have
a clue about being a responsible parent.  I neglected
my son, and I'm paying for it now."

  The same resolve she used to straighten out
her own life has been applied to finding help for Mar-
tin.  A friend told Donna about Heart to Heart Youth
Services, which accepted him for treatment.  Six
months into residence at a group home, he seems
amenable to a diverse, highly structured program
designed to turn troubled kids into responsible citi-
zens.  Donna believes it has saved Martin's life.
  "It's a cycle,"  says Marian Kubiak, Heart to Heart's
co-founder. "Most of the kids who become victimizers
have been victims themselves.  Society might consid-
er them perpetrators based on their behavior, but
they come to us as victims."
  Physical abuse, sexual abuse and general neglect
are included among the baggage most of the 36 kids,
ages 4 to 14, bring with them to Heart to Heart's
six group homes. While the root causes of their be-
havior problems are addressed in counseling, the
understanding is that those causes cease to exist
once they check in.  In time, and with help, their be-
havior problems should likewise disappear.
  "The program is based on acceptance and develop-
ment of individual responsibility," Kubiak said.  "We
train them to make decisions, and to recognize that
there are natural and logical consequences for the
choices they make, good and bad.
  "We're teaching them the right way~ and in many
cases all they've known is the wrong way. The rou-
