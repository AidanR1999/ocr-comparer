Joyful patrons of all races
drawn to S. African club

  JOHANNESBURG -~ At the Getahead she-
been, the joint is jumping to the up-tempo jazz
and blues of the Elite African Swingsters.
  Revelers, packed tighter than kernels on a
corn cob, swig beer from cans and Southern
Comfort from tin cups.
  The shebeen queen -~ an African woman in a
bright turquoise headdress and matching skirt
-~ incites the crowd to boogie down.
  Shebeens have long been a ramshackle refuge
for black township residents, a place where they
can drink cheaply and let loose. They say there
are 7,000 shebeens in the township of Soweto
alone. But this shebeen is different from all the
rest -~ it's tucked down a side street in Rose-
bank, an upscale suburb of Johannesburg, and
its patrons include people of all races.
  The Getahead, which


opened election week as an
experiment, is South Afri-
ca's first yuppie shebeen.
  "This is like actually
weird," said Nothando
Mathe, a Zulu whose first
name means "with love," as
a white man doing the Wa-
tusi danced with her and
two of her friends simulta-


neously.
  But Mathe, 23, quickly added, "I feel free, I
feel wonderful. This is what the new South Afri-
ca is going to be like.
  "It's really lovely now the way we are actually
adapting," said Mathe, a publicist for a televi-
sion station. "We never went to school with
them, we never sit in restaurants with them, we
don't know them. This should have happened a
long time ago. We should have been mixing 20,
30 years ago."
  The Getahead -~ which charges a $3 cover to
raise money for small business start-ups -~ actu-
ally imported a genuine shebeen queen, Dolly
Ngubane, from a shebeen in Orlando West, the
oldest district in Soweto. (To attract male cus-
tomers, shebeens are usually run by unmarried
women.)
  Despite its attempts at realism -~ laundry
dangled from a clothes line above the bar, graf-
fiti was scrawled across a chalkboard and the
fare included mopani worms, an African delica-
cy charitably described as an acquired taste -~
the Getahead wasn't quite funky enough.
  "It's too clean, and the drinks are too expen-
sive ($1 a beer)," said one African observer. "But
it's not a bad start."
  Like many whites, Lauren Ekon felt a ripple


of excitement at her first shebeen experience -~
even if it wasn't entirely realistic. "I was ner-
vous to come here," said Ekon, a lawyer in black
leggings and knee boots. While a few bold
whites occasionally venture into township she-
beens, "It's the first time ever blacks and whites
have been together in a shebeen out in the
open," Ekon said.
  Such was the novelty that black millionaires
and Afrikaners alike squeezed their way inside.
  The buzz at the Getahead indicates just how
quickly South Africans of all races are trying to
remake their country.
  "I'm tired of feeling guilty all the time," said
Kathy Thorrold, a 21-year-old optometry stu-
dent who was hawking T-shirts at the Geta-
head.
  "It was uncomfortable," agreed writer Bren-
dan Cline, 36. "I never voted before because I
didn't see any point -~ if most people weren't al-
lowed to vote, it was just a farcical election."
  But it will take time before the cancer of rac-
ism can be cut out. The day the voting started in
Durban, the erstwhile owner of the Combat
Force Security Co., Montague Kenneth Norman
Reeves, was found guilty of the murders of two
black men in a neighboring township in 1990.
  In the first case, Reeves offered his security
guards "100 rand ($28) for every kaffir you kill."
(Kaffir is a racist term for black Africans.) One
of Reeves' guards was sentenced to 12 years in
prison for murdering a black man as the man
was walking down the street singing a song.
  In the second case, Reeves, 52, ran down an
inebriated black man with his jeep as the man
stumbled out of a shebeen.
  For these crimes Reeves, whom the judge
called a liar, was released on only $285 bail
pending sentencing.
  The Reeves case is a particularly ugly aberra-
tion. More common is the sentiment expressed
by a South African flight attendant: "My daugh-
ter goes to school with blacks; still I wouldn't
want one in my house," he said. "I have nothing
in common with them." When a reporter sug-
gested that surely there were some Africans he
had something in common with, this 33-y~~r-
old product of apartheid replied, "I haven't met
one yet."
  Nevertheless, this week at least, racial har-
mony abounded in South Africa.
  Bobby Heaney, a 44-year-old director who is
working on a TV series set in a township, spo~~
for thousands of South Africans when he ~~~~~
"Wednesday -~ the day I voted -~ has got ~~~~~~~~~
happiest day of my life, without a doubt."
  Heaney, who is white, added, "To see th~~~~~
when we no longer feel guilty and embarr~~~~~
is a tremendous feeling."
