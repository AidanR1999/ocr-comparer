Cuba to make it easier for exiles to visit


  HAVANA, Cuba (AP) -~ Cuban
Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina
promised Saturday to make it
easier for exiles to visit their
homeland and for their children
to study there.
  Robaina spoke to Cuban exiles
from the United States and 28
other countries at the first meet-
ing between exiles and Fidel Cas-
tro's government since 1978.
  Cuba hopes the three-day con-


ference, which ends today, will
improve relations between the
cash-strapped communist govern-
ment and about 1 million exiles.
  Robaina said Cuba will stop re-
quiring exiles who left legally to
wait five years before they can
return.
  He also said "a small number"
of emigrants' children will be able
to study at Cuban universities,
although they will have to pay.
